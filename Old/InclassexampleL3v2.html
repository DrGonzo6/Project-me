				<h3> Moron tells handicap guy to stand, hilarity ensues
				</h3> 
					<img class="kanye" src="Images/kanyew.jpg" alt="SillyKanye">On Friday, Kanye West stopped a concert in Sydney to demand that everyone stand up. He looked around the crowd, pointing out those slow to rise. He said, "Unless you got a handicap pass and you get special parking and s**t," he simply would not continue the show until everyone was on their feet. The crowd shouted, "Stand up!" or even, "F***ing stand up!"
					After a minute, West pointed out two people who, he said, "don't want to stand up." One of them waved a prosthetic leg in the air, so West turned to the last holdout. He demanded to know if the fan was in a wheelchair. The crowd laughed. He complained, "This is the longest I've had to wait to do a song, it's unbelievable." Finally, as the crowd was shouting that the fan was in a wheelchair, West sent a bodyguard to verify it, then finally started his song, "The Good Life."
