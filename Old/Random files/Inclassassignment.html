		    In 2013 the concentration of major greenhouse gases shattered previous
		    records; CO2 in the atmosphere was more than 
	    
		    1.5 times its preindustrial
		    level, and methane, another heat-trapping gas, was at more than twice its
		    earlier level.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		    The new data, released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO),
		    SHOWED that carbon dioxide levels increased more from 2012 to 2013 than
		    during any other year since 1984. Their research indicated that this could
		    be due to a decline in the Earth"s capacity to absorb the heat-trapping gas
		    in addition to increasing emissions that have built up in the
		    atmosphere.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		    The new findings said the rise in CO2 levels is outpacing fossil fuel
		    use, indicating that the planet"s natural ability to soak up the gas may be
		    declining, the report said.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		    'It may be due to the reduced uptake of CO2 by the biosphere,' WMO
		    Secretary General Michel Jarraud told a news conference. 'If that is
		    CONFIRMED, it is of significant concern.' He said more research would need
		    to be done to confirm that theory.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		    Absolute levels of greenhouse gases are at record highs, something the
		    WMO said would have increasingly negative effects across the globe.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		    'We know without any doubt that our climate is changing and our weather
		    is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of
		    fossil fuels,' Jarraud said.
		    </p>

		    <p>
		    The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is the result of
		    a complex interplay of chemical processes and absorption of CO2 by the
		    oceans and plant life. In another SIGN of the increasingly clear effects of
		    climate change, the oceans are growing acidic at a rate faster than ever
		    before, according to the report.
