			<p>
				Hey Internet! My name is Nick Wagner, and I thought I would share some information about myself. I grew up in the downtown area of Cleveland, Ohio, and was raised there for all of my life.
			</p>
			<p>
				After getting through highscool, I decided that staying in the North East was not something I wanted to continue doing so I went to the University of South Carolina to study international business, as well as minor in Mandardin Chinese, thinking that it would eventually take me somewhere.
				Once I graduated I needed to find a job so I landed in New York and got a job working for Ernst and Young Accounting firm. Though I do not believe I would like to stay here for the long run of my career, it has been a great starting ground for me, and I can only hope that I will have the courage one day to leave.
